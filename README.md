# My Raspberry Pi Ansible Playbooks #

These playbooks will help you setup, provision, tinker and otherwise interfere with your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)!

Obviously to make use of these playbooks you will need to install [Ansible](http://ansible.com/), which is a commandline tool which enables simple provisioning of remote servers.  

Ansible doesn't require anything to be installed on your remote servers like similar tools such as [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) and [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/) do, as all that is needed for configurations is that you have key based [ssh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) access to the remote server.

This makes it the perfect choice for when you just plugged a new [SD card](https://www.sdcard.org/) into your shiny Raspberry Pi.

Also, I think this tool might be used in some enterprise environments for like datacentres and junk but pfftâ€¦ It was clearly designed for interfering with Raspberry Pi's!
